                <p>
                    I am a student in my second year of the Computer Science program at the University of Victoria. I love programming, software development, and designing video games. I have created a few video games over the years in my free time. I am always working on more projects to strengthen my skills.

                        This is the third video game I made. It's a ballistics strategy game where you play as a tank have to defeat all the enemy tanks. I had to design physics simulation and enemy behaviour for this game which I had never done before. It's definitely the most technically complex game I've made. I think it turned out well though and I am proud of it!

                        This is the second video game I made. This project definitely helped give me a better understanding of Unity. It's pretty simple but I am very happy with how it turned out as I was able to make a polished game in little time.

                        This was the first video game that I worked on. I worked with a team of four other people to create it. I was the head game designer and the sole programmer for the project. This project gave me a deep understanding of Unity and allowed me to strengthen my skills in computer science.
